An Introduction to Windows Exploit Development
---

_An Introduction to Windows Exploit Development_ is a free course I created for the students of Southeast Missouri State University- based on my exploit development background. Feel free to use this lab manual and follow along. I hope this course inspires you to want to know more. It is all about knowledge sharing :)
