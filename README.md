An Introduction to Windows Exploit Development
---

_An Introduction to Windows Exploit Development_ is a free course I created for the students of Southeast Missouri State University- based on my exploit development background. Feel free to use this lab manual and follow along. I hope this course inspires you to want to know more. It is all about knowledge sharing :)

Topics include (over the span of multiple lab manuals): 

1. Fuzzing (basic concepts)
2. Instruction pointer overwrites
3. Structured exception handler (SEH) bypasses
4. Bypassing restrictive space
5. Manual and alphanumeric shellcoding
6. Bypassing ASLR and DEP
7. Kernel mode exploitaiton
